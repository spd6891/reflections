When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
A: When I work with different computers o when is necesary work with  many
people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:One reason is that maybe you don't want pull a version that you are sure have
problems, o maybe you don't wanna share a change
